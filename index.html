            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Astrid French, and I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in March 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Here are some of the projects I have created since starting university:</p>

            <h3>1. My Inventory - Android App</h3>
            <img src="images/Sign_in_1.jpg" alt="Welcome page">
            <p>This project is from the <strong>CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming</strong> class, completed between July and August 2024, where I designed and developed a sorting inventory app for Android. I chose this project because it showcases my skills in designing applications while prioritizing user needs. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to create user-friendly interfaces by carefully selecting the appropriate layout grids, color schemes, and intuitive navigation. The design and functionality reflect my focus on enhancing the user experience, ensuring the app is not only visually appealing but also easy to use.</p>
            <p>This project also highlights my technical proficiency in coding with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>, and connecting to local storage to develop a functional Android app. By adding features like inventory sorting, editing, and adjustments, the project showcases my ability to address real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I envisioned this app for small business owners who need a convenient way to manage their items for sale directly from their phones. The design was straightforward, allowing users to add items, remove them, and adjust or edit their quantities.</p>

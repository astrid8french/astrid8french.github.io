            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Astrid French, and I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in March 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Here are some of the projects I have created since starting university:</p>

            <h3>1. My Inventory - Software Design and Engineer</h3>
            <img src="images/Sign_in_1.jpg" alt="Welcome page" style="width: 180px;">
            <p>For this category, I selected my project from the CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming class, completed between July and August 2024. This project involved designing and developing a sorting inventory app for Android, showcasing my ability to design applications while prioritizing user needs. I demonstrated my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces by carefully selecting appropriate layout grids, color schemes, and intuitive navigation. The design and functionality reflected my focus on enhancing the user experience, ensuring the app was not only visually appealing but also easy to use.</p>

    <p>The app was developed using Java for functionality and XML for design, with the primary goal of helping users easily organize and manage their inventory. I envisioned this app as a valuable tool for small business owners who needed a convenient way to track their items for sale directly from their phones. The app’s straightforward design allowed users to add items, remove them, and modify their quantities effortlessly. Additionally, the project highlighted my technical proficiency in coding and integrating local storage to develop a fully functional Android app. By incorporating features such as inventory sorting, editing, and adjustments, I was able to address real-world problems efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Enhancements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security system:</strong> I enforced access controls, ensuring that only authorized users could modify the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> I refactored the code to improve its modularity, making it easier to maintain, edit, and debug.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendliness:</strong> I added a search bar feature, allowing users to quickly find items by name or ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Input validation and error handling:</strong> I implemented input validation and error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid inputs and ensure the app could handle errors without crashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance optimization:</strong> I integrated more efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize the app’s performance and responsiveness.</li>
    </ul>

            <h3>2. ContactService </h3>
            <p>This project is based on an assignment from <strong>CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance </strong> (April 2024). It is a simple Java program that allows users to add, delete, and update contacts. I believe that by choosing this artifact, I can showcase my ability to select the right data structure and demonstrate how I write more efficient and well-structured methods.</p>
            <p>Looking back at my code, I see several areas for improvement, including selecting the right algorithm and data structure, enhancing encapsulation, and improving validation and error handling.
For this enhancement, I have switched to a HashMap to achieve O(1) time complexity instead of using an ArrayList. Additionally, I have implemented input validation and error handling to prevent invalid inputs and ensure errors are properly managed, preventing the application from crashing.
To improve flexibility and scalability, I previously had four separate methods for updating a contact. Now, I have consolidated them into a single method, making the class more adaptable to changes without creating unnecessary methods. </p>

            <h3>3. AnimalShelter.py </h3>
            <p>
            This project is based on an assignment from <strong>CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts</strong> in June 2024. 
            It is a simple Python implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
            using <strong>MongoDB</strong> as the database. The project focuses on interacting with the 
            <strong>AAC database</strong>, particularly the <strong>animals collection</strong>, to manage a list of animals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The application was developed in <strong>Python</strong>. Looking back at my code, I implemented 
            <strong>CRUD operations</strong> with practical error handling, added an <strong>aggregation pipeline</strong> 
            to manage data more efficiently, and created <strong>indexes</strong> for each animal to improve search performance.
        </p>

        <p>Key Aspects of This CRUD Implementation</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Connectivity:</strong> How the program connects to the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The use of an <strong>aggregation pipeline</strong> and <strong>indexes</strong> to optimize queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The program provides clear error messages when issues occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even if an error occurs, the program will output a detailed explanation of what happened.

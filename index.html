        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Astrid French, and I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in March 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Here are some of the projects I have created since starting university:</p>

    <h2>Course Outcome 1:</h2>
    <p>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.</p>
    <p>I facilitated collaboration between the user, product owner, and myself as the engineer responsible for building the software according to the requirements. I also ensured that the software was checked against the documented specifications and aligned with the feedback provided.</p>

    <h2>Course Outcome 2:</h2>
    <p>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</p>
    <p>I ensured that the software was developed and designed according to the established procedures and feedback, meeting professional-quality standards.</p>

    <h2>Course Outcome 3:</h2>
    <p>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</p>
    <p>In my projects, I applied algorithmic principles to design solutions that effectively address the problem at hand. In particular, for the ContactService project, I chose a more efficient data structure, such as a HashMap, to improve the performance and ensure faster data access. This decision allowed me to optimize the application's functionality, ensuring it could handle a larger number of contacts efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Course Outcome 4:</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</p>
    <p>Throughout my projects, I employed various techniques, tools, and programming languages to implement computing solutions that meet industry-specific goals. For example, I utilized Java and XML for mobile development and Python for working with databases.</p>

    <h2>Course Outcome 5:</h2>
    <p>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to identify potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</p>
    <p>In all my projects, I ensured that only the intended users could edit the data, and I implemented input validation to prevent vulnerabilities and design flaws.</p>

            <h3>1. My Inventory - Software Design and Engineering</h3>
            <img src="images/Sign_in_1.jpg" alt="Welcome page" style="width: 180px;">
            <p>For this category, I selected my project from the CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming class, completed between July and August 2024. This project involved designing and developing a sorting inventory app for Android, showcasing my ability to design applications while prioritizing user needs. I demonstrated my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces by carefully selecting appropriate layout grids, color schemes, and intuitive navigation. The design and functionality reflected my focus on enhancing the user experience, ensuring the app was not only visually appealing but also easy to use.</p>

    <p>The app was developed using Java for functionality and XML for design, with the primary goal of helping users easily organize and manage their inventory. I envisioned this app as a valuable tool for small business owners who needed a convenient way to track their items for sale directly from their phones. The app’s straightforward design allowed users to add items, remove them, and modify their quantities effortlessly. Additionally, the project highlighted my technical proficiency in coding and integrating local storage to develop a fully functional Android app. By incorporating features such as inventory sorting, editing, and adjustments, I was able to address real-world problems efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Enhancements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security system:</strong> I enforced access controls, ensuring that only authorized users could modify the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> I refactored the code to improve its modularity, making it easier to maintain, edit, and debug.</li>
        <li><strong>User-friendliness:</strong> I added a search bar feature, allowing users to quickly find items by name or ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Input validation and error handling:</strong> I implemented input validation and error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid inputs and ensure the app could handle errors without crashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance optimization:</strong> I integrated more efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize the app’s performance and responsiveness.</li>

            <h3>2. ContactService </h3>
            <p>This project is based on an assignment from <strong>CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance </strong> (April 2024). It is a simple Java program that allows users to add, delete, and update contacts. I believe that by choosing this artifact, I can showcase my ability to select the right data structure and demonstrate how I write more efficient and well-structured methods.</p>
            <p>Looking back at my code, I see several areas for improvement, including selecting the right algorithm and data structure, enhancing encapsulation, and improving validation and error handling.
For this enhancement, I have switched to a HashMap to achieve O(1) time complexity instead of using an ArrayList. Additionally, I have implemented input validation and error handling to prevent invalid inputs and ensure errors are properly managed, preventing the application from crashing.
To improve flexibility and scalability, I previously had four separate methods for updating a contact. Now, I have consolidated them into a single method, making the class more adaptable to changes without creating unnecessary methods. </p>

            <h3>3. AnimalShelter.py </h3>
            <p>
            This project is based on an assignment from <strong>CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts</strong> in June 2024. 
            It is a simple Python implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
            using <strong>MongoDB</strong> as the database. The project focuses on interacting with the 
            <strong>AAC database</strong>, particularly the <strong>animals collection</strong>, to manage a list of animals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The application was developed in <strong>Python</strong>. Looking back at my code, I implemented 
            <strong>CRUD operations</strong> with practical error handling, added an <strong>aggregation pipeline</strong> 
            to manage data more efficiently, and created <strong>indexes</strong> for each animal to improve search performance.
        </p>

        <p>Key Aspects of This CRUD Implementation</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Connectivity:</strong> How the program connects to the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The use of an <strong>aggregation pipeline</strong> and <strong>indexes</strong> to optimize queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The program provides clear error messages when issues occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even if an error occurs, the program will output a detailed explanation of what happened.

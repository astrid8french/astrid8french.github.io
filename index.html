            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Astrid French, and I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in March 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Here are some of the projects I have created since starting university:</p>

            <h3>1. My Inventory - Android App</h3>
            <img src="images/Sign_in_1.jpg" alt="Welcome page" style="width: 180px;">
            <p>This project is from the <strong>CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming</strong> class, completed between July and August 2024, where I designed and developed a sorting inventory app for Android. I chose this project because it showcases my skills in designing applications while prioritizing user needs. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to create user-friendly interfaces by carefully selecting the appropriate layout grids, color schemes, and intuitive navigation. The design and functionality reflect my focus on enhancing the user experience, ensuring the app is not only visually appealing but also easy to use.</p>
            <p>This project also highlights my technical proficiency in coding with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>, and connecting to local storage to develop a functional Android app. By adding features like inventory sorting, editing, and adjustments, the project showcases my ability to address real-world problems. I envisioned this app for small business owners who need a convenient way to manage their items for sale directly from their phones. The design was straightforward, allowing users to add items, remove them, and adjust or edit their quantities.</p>

            <h3>2. ContactService </h3>
            <p>This project is based on an assignment from <strong>CS320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance </strong> (April 2024). It is a simple Java program that allows users to add, delete, and update contacts. I believe that by choosing this artifact, I can showcase my ability to select the right data structure and demonstrate how I write more efficient and well-structured methods.</p>
            <p>Looking back at my code, I see several areas for improvement, including selecting the right algorithm and data structure, enhancing encapsulation, and improving validation and error handling.
For this enhancement, I have switched to a HashMap to achieve O(1) time complexity instead of using an ArrayList. Additionally, I have implemented input validation and error handling to prevent invalid inputs and ensure errors are properly managed, preventing the application from crashing.
To improve flexibility and scalability, I previously had four separate methods for updating a contact. Now, I have consolidated them into a single method, making the class more adaptable to changes without creating unnecessary methods. </p>
